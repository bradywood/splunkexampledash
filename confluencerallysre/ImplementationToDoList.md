Implementation To-Do List
This document outlines the development tasks required to build the SRE Maturity Tracker application.

Phase 1: Project Setup & Configuration (Est. 1-2 hours)
[ ] Initialize Git Repository: Create a new repository for the project.

[ ] Create Project Structure:

sre_tracker.py (main application file)

database.py (for SQLite interaction)

config.py (to load environment variables)

requirements.txt

.gitignore (to exclude .env, __pycache__, etc.)

[ ] Create .env.example file: Provide a template for users to create their .env file.

[ ] Write interactive_setup.py:

[ ] Prompt for flow names and asset names.

[ ] Generate flows.csv.

[ ] Generate maturity_model.csv based on the defined SRE pillars.

[ ] Create the initial sre_data.db SQLite database from these CSVs.

Phase 2: Core Application & API Integration (Est. 4-6 hours)
[ ] Develop sre_tracker.py CLI:

[ ] Use argparse or click to handle commands (setup, assess, report, sync).

[ ] Build Rally API Module:

[ ] Function to authenticate with API Key.

[ ] Function to fetch work items based on a parent ID and tags.

[ ] Function to create a new User Story from a template.

[ ] Build Confluence API Module:

[ ] Function to authenticate with username and API token.

[ ] Function to get the content of a page by its ID.

[ ] Function to find a specific table within the page's HTML content.

[ ] Function to update the page content with a modified table.

[ ] Build Database Module (database.py):

[ ] Function to connect to the SQLite database.

[ ] Function to read the maturity matrix into a pandas DataFrame.

[ ] Function to update a specific row in the database.

[ ] Function to export the database to a CSV file.

Phase 3: Workflow Implementation (Est. 3-4 hours)
[ ] Implement the assess command:

[ ] Load the maturity model questions.

[ ] Prompt the user to select an asset and capability to assess.

[ ] Ask the guided questions and determine the new maturity level.

[ ] Update the sre_data.db with the new status and notes.

[ ] Implement the report command:

[ ] Query the database for all items marked Red without a Rally ID.

[ ] Generate rally_import.csv.

[ ] Generate the Confluence wiki markup for the To-Do list and save to confluence_page.txt.

[ ] Implement the sync command:

[ ] Fetch all relevant stories from Rally.

[ ] Compare with the data in sre_data.db.

[ ] Update the status of any completed items in the database.

[ ] Call the Confluence API function to update the "SRE To-Do List" page.

Phase 4: Documentation & Finalization (Est. 1-2 hours)
[ ] Create a README.md file:

[ ] Explain the purpose of the project.

[ ] Provide clear setup instructions.

[ ] Document the command-line usage for each script/command.

[ ] Add comments and docstrings to the Python code.

[ ] Test the end-to-end workflow thoroughly.
