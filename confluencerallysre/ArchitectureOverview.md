SRE Maturity Tracking: Architectural Overview
This document outlines the architecture, workflow, and implementation plan for a semi-automated system to track and improve Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) maturity across your engineering teams.

1. System Components & Data Flow
This system is designed to integrate your existing tools (Git, Splunk, Confluence, Rally) with a central Python application that acts as the orchestration engine.

Git: Serves as the single source of truth for the configuration and state of your SRE maturity.

Stores: The core Python application (sre_tracker.py), configuration files (flows.csv, maturity_model.csv), and the current state of the maturity matrix (sre_data.db).

Purpose: Provides version control, history, and a clear audit trail for all changes to maturity levels.

Splunk: Acts as the real-time operational dashboard.

Function: Visualizes the current health of your application flows (e.g., login, checkout).

Integration: SREs use the Splunk dashboard to identify recurring issues that indicate a need for maturity uplift. While not directly integrated with the script, it's the primary trigger for an SRE to initiate an assessment.

Confluence: Serves as the knowledge base and reporting dashboard.

Function:

SRE Maturity Model: A static page detailing the maturity levels and assessment questions.

SRE To-Do List: A dynamic page that is updated by the Python script. It shows all teams their assigned SRE-related tasks and their current status.

Integration: The Python script uses the Confluence REST API to read the initial state and push updates to the To-Do List page.

Rally: The work tracking system.

Function: Manages the actual engineering work (User Stories, Tasks) required to improve maturity.

Integration: The Python script uses the Rally REST API to:

Fetch the status of existing SRE-related stories.

Generate a CSV file (rally_import.csv) for creating new stories when a maturity gap is identified.

Local Python Application (sre_tracker.py): The central engine that orchestrates the entire workflow.

Function: Provides a command-line interface (CLI) for SREs to interact with the system. It reads from and writes to all integrated tools.

Database: Uses a local SQLite database (sre_data.db) to store and manage the maturity matrix, which is initialized from your CSV files.

    SRE->>Splunk: 1. Observes recurring issue
    SRE->>App: 2. Runs `python sre_tracker.py assess`
    App-->>SRE: Asks guided questions
    SRE->>App: Answers questions
    App->>Git: 3. Updates `sre_data.db` and commits change
    SRE->>App: 4. Runs `python sre_tracker.py generate-reports`
    App->>Rally: 5. Creates new User Story via API
    App->>Confluence: 6. Updates "SRE To-Do List" page via API
    AssetTeam->>Rally: 7. Views and works on the new story
    AssetTeam->>Rally: 8. Marks story as "Completed"
    SRE->>App: 9. Runs `python sre_tracker.py sync`
    App->>Rally: 10. Fetches status of all SRE stories
    App->>Git: 11. Updates `sre_data.db` with "Completed" status and commits
    App->>Confluence: 12. Updates "SRE To-Do List" page to reflect completion

3. Confluence Table Strategy
Two key pages will be used in Confluence:

A. SRE Maturity Uplift Tracker (The "To-Do List")

Purpose: This is the primary dashboard for all teams. It is dynamically updated by the Python script and provides a real-time view of all SRE-related work.

Management: The script will find a table with a specific title on the page (e.g., "SRE Action Items") and update its rows.

Columns:

Priority

Required for Go Live

Target Milestone

Owner (Asset/SRE/Support)

Flow

Asset Name

Task

Description

Rally Card (This will be a hyperlink to the Rally story)

Status (Pulled from Rally)

Category (e.g., Monitoring, Incident Response)

B. SRE Service Reliability Hierarchy (The "Rulebook")

Purpose: A static, detailed reference page that contains the full SRE Maturity Model. SREs use this as the guide for their assessments.

Content: A detailed table outlining the criteria for each maturity level (1-5) across all SRE categories. This page is updated manually by the SRE team when standards evolve.

4. Development and Implementation Plan
This is the step-by-step guide for building and deploying this solution.

Milestone 1: Setup and Configuration (Local)

Create Project Structure: Set up a Git repository with the initial file structure.

Develop interactive_setup.py: Create the script to generate the initial flows.csv and maturity_model.csv.

Develop Database Module: Create database.py to handle the creation of the SQLite database and the import/export of CSV data.

Configure .env: Create the .env file with placeholders for all necessary API keys and IDs.

Milestone 2: Core Application Logic

Develop sre_tracker.py: Create the main command-line interface (CLI) application.

Implement Rally Integration: Write the functions to connect to the Rally API, fetch stories based on tags and hierarchy, and create new stories.

Implement Confluence Integration: Write the functions to connect to the Confluence API, find a table by its title on a page, read its contents, and update its contents.

Develop Assessment Module: Implement the interactive assessment logic in update_maturity.sh (or integrate it into the Python app) that uses the maturity_model.csv.

Milestone 3: Reporting and Workflow Automation

Implement generate-reports command: This will create the rally_import.csv and update the Confluence "To-Do List" page.

Implement sync command: This will fetch statuses from Rally and update both the local database and the Confluence page.

Write Documentation: Create a README.md with clear instructions for setup and usage.

Git Commit Strategy:

Commit after each logical step (e.g., "feat: Add Rally API connection module").

Use clear commit messages that explain what was changed and why.

Tag releases (e.g., v1.0) once the core functionality is stable.
